## Introduction

Congratulates on your admission to ZJU's CS program! 

You are now one of those that do not worry about transferring to CS right before their graduation.

Stepping into CS program is a promising first step towards success, but it is far from it. Considering this, how you would end up four years from now?

You may:

- be admitted to Stanford/MIT/CMU/UCB etc. to continue a higher level study and research
- receive a highly competitive offer from top companies like FLAG/BAT

Or you may:

- fail countless courses and experience a hard time to graduate on time
- fail to be admitted to your dream graduate-level programs
- fail to find a work-life-balance job or a well-paid job

Clearly everyone's definition of success and envision of the future differs, but we all know nobody wants to be the latter one. 

This repo is here to help you succeed through this 4-year program in ZJU CS.

We wish you succeed and never become us, the [**zjufailure**](https://github.com/zjufailure)

## Must-Know Skills

- [ ] Learn to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), to better cooperate with your teammates in course projects.
- [ ] Learn to identify the courses that you can really benefit from and pay more attention to them. Spend more time on core courses such as FDS, ADS, network, operating system and database system since these courses can be greatly helpful to make you more competitive no matter you plan to pursue further education or you are gonna enter the workforce.
- [ ] Learn to find references for your courses. It should be easy to find most solutions to the course exercises. You can even find some useful tips for course enrollment and final exmas in this repo [zju-icicles](https://github.com/QSCTech/zju-icicles). Making good use of these references can save you a lot of time.

## Simple Facts

- [ ] Making the right decision is far more important than making great effort.
- [ ] Being aware of current situation including but not limited to what your schoolmates are busy with, how the macroenvironment is, where you could get the latest news such as exchange program, internship opportunities, etc will certainly help you to get prepared better.
- [ ] Most courses in ZJU CS are not worthy of your precious time to go into the room and stay there for hours.
- [ ] The finals of some courses remain almost unchanged every semester. Thus, if you can get a copy of the final exam paper in last semester for reference, the final could be unbelievably easy.
- [ ] It's possible to participate in some exchange programs which are marked for CKC students only. Most host institutes don't even care which college you are studying in. Instead of expecting to be recommended by ZJU, you could visit the host institute's program homepage and apply for the program on your own.
