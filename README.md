## Introduction

Congratulates on your admission to ZJU's CS program! 

You are now one of those that do not worry about transferring to CS right before their graduation.

Stepping into CS program is a promising first step towards success, but it is far from it. Considering this, how you would end up four years from now?

You may:

- be admitted to Stanford/MIT/CMU/UCB etc. to continue a higher level study and research
- receive a highly competitive offer from top companies like FLAG/BAT

Or you may:

- fail countless courses and experience a hard time to graduate on time
- fail to be admitted to your dream graduate-level programs
- fail to find a work-life-balance job or a well-paid job

Clearly everyone's definition of success and envision of the future differs, but we all know nobody wants to be the latter one. 

This repo is here to help you succeed through this 4-year program in ZJU CS.

We wish you succeed and never become us, the [**zjufailure**](https://github.com/zjufailure)
